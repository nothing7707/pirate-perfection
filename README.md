Use SuperBLT and add files to the mods folder in Payday 2.

01/2022

Added V.I.P. edition.

---------------------------------------

I am not supporting or maintaining this, I am putting up a separate branch that will work without modification with the latest version of Super BLT (as of April 2023) as the original archive has a bugged file that causes the game to crash upon loading the lobby. I've had no issues using this in game although it is not tested extensively. Any limited testing was done on the VIP version.

Install this like any normal mod, BLT first, launch game and close, then install mod. F Keys to interact.

-Nothing
